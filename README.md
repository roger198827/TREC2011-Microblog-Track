TREC-2011: Building Effective Search in Twitter

Explore initial ideas on building an effective search tool over tweet stream as a participation in TREC2011 microblog track. Among those ideas are tweet expansion with short representation of terms that frequently co-occur with hashtags and URLs, and re-ranking based on statistics that estimate user popularity (using replies and mentions), tweet popularity, URL popularity and user topic authority (using simple user profiles). Initial results show that re-ranking improves the effectiveness while expansion sometimes harms it. Overall, the system built for the task is indeed a great resource for further extensions and experiments.
